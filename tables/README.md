Observables predicted by FFB model in Li, Dekel et al. 2024.

Data tables are provided for different redshifts (z),
and maximum star formation efficiency epsilon_max (see Li+24 for details).
For UV luminosity, results with three models for dust are provided (none, disc, shell scenario).

You can download all the data tables in batch via this link: https://github.com/syrte/ffb_predict/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

## SFE
Star formation efficiency as function of halo mass.

## SMF
Stellar mass function.

## UVLF
UV luminosity function.

## cosmic density
### rho_sfr
Cumulative density of SFR for galaxies brighter than given M_UV.

### rho_star(Mstar)
Cumulative density of stellar mass for galaxies more massive than given stellar mass.

### rho_star(MUV)
Cumulative density of stellar mass for galaxies brighter than given M_UV.

### rho_UV
Cumulative density of UV luminosity for galaxies brighter than given M_UV.
